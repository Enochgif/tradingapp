Technologies Used
This project leverages a modern and scalable technology stack:

Frontend:

[e.g., React.js / Next.js / Vue.js / Angular] - A JavaScript library/framework for building user interfaces.

[e.g., Tailwind CSS / Material-UI / Bootstrap] - For responsive and aesthetically pleasing styling.

[e.g., Chart.js / D3.js / ApexCharts] - For interactive data visualization and charting.

[e.g., WebSockets] - For real-time data streaming.

Backend:

[e.g., Node.js / Python (Django/Flask) / Go / Java (Spring Boot)] - The server-side runtime/framework.

[e.g., Express.js / Django REST Framework / FastAPI] - For building RESTful APIs.

[e.g., WebSocket libraries (e.g., Socket.IO for Node.js)] - For real-time communication.

Database:

[e.g., PostgreSQL / MongoDB / MySQL / Firestore] - For persistent data storage.

[e.g., Redis] - For caching and real-time data storage (if used).

Deployment & Infrastructure (Optional, if applicable):

[e.g., Docker] - For containerization.

[e.g., AWS / Google Cloud Platform / Azure] - Cloud hosting services.

[e.g., Nginx] - As a reverse proxy/web server.

Other Tools:

[e.g., Git] - Version control.

[e.g., npm / yarn / pip] - Package management.

Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

[e.g., Node.js (LTS version)]

[e.g., npm or yarn]

[e.g., Python 3.x (if using Python backend)]

[e.g., Docker (optional, for containerized setup)]

[e.g., Git]

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/[YourGitHubUsername]/[your-repository-name].git
cd [your-repository-name]

Backend Setup:

# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend # or server, api, etc.

# Install dependencies
[e.g., npm install / pip install -r requirements.txt]

# Configure environment variables (e.g., database connection string, API keys)
# Create a .env file based on .env.example and fill in your details.

# Run database migrations (if applicable)
[e.g., npx prisma migrate dev / python manage.py migrate]

# Start the backend server
[e.g., npm start / python app.py / python manage.py runserver]

The backend server should now be running, typically on http://localhost:[YourBackendPort].

Frontend Setup:

# Navigate back to the root and then into the frontend directory
cd ../frontend # or client, web, etc.

# Install dependencies
[e.g., npm install / yarn install]

# Configure environment variables (e.g., backend API URL)
# Create a .env file based on .env.example and fill in your details.

# Start the frontend development server
[e.g., npm start / yarn start / npm run dev]

The frontend application should now be accessible in your browser, typically on http://localhost:[YourFrontendPort].

Usage
Once both the frontend and backend servers are running:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:[YourFrontendPort].

Register a new user account or log in if you already have one.

Explore the various features:

View real-time market data on the dashboard.

Use the charting tools to analyze asset performance.
